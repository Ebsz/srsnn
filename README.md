# Stochastic Models of Recurrent Spiking Neural Networks
This repository contains the code originally written for the masters thesis _Heterogeneous Neuron Dynamics in Stochastic Models of Recurrent Spiking Neural Networks_.

This includes a preliminary implementation of an algebraic formalism derived from _connection-set algebra_([Djurfeldt, 2012](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12021-012-9146-1))
that enables the definition of abstract patterns of RSNNs, as well as a framework for optimizing such networks.
